Time Complexcity:
  Efficient time to run an algorithm is time complexcity. It is denoted by "Big O" notaion. Big O follows worst case to get the given value.
    
    => List Time Complexcity :
    1. append() -> O(1) directly adds at end.
    2. remove() -> O(n) searchs the given value from 0 to n index takes n sec
    3. pop()    -> O(1) it doesn't searchs, directly removes last element or specified index element 

    => Set Time Complexcity :
    1. add() -> O(1)
    2. remove() -> O(1) 
      In set hash table also called as hash maps or dictionaries. Which makes id for every values to move directly to the value.

Different types of time complexcity are:-
1. O(1)       : constant Time
2. O(log n)   : Logarithmic Time
3. O(n)       : Linear Time
4. O(n log n) : Linearithmic Time
5. O(n^2)     : Quadritic Time                                                                             
6. O(n^k)     : Polynomial Time
7. O(2^n)     : Exponential Time
8. O(n!)      : Factorial Time
